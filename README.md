### Hi there üëã
---
My name is Lucas Ferreira. I'm a transport planner and data analyst from Brazil. I'm currently working on Transitar Consultoria and completing a master's degree in transportation planning.

I just started this personal account, and I'll put things that I think be useful in transportation planning and data analysis (or other cool things).

### Research and work interests :bus:
---
I'm particularly interested in issues concerning transportation inequalities and how the planning process can aid in the creation of more equitable cities. My current research examines how budget constraints affect public transportation accessibility, particularly for low-income people, analyzing this issue from the Capability Approach (CA) perspective.
