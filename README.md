### Hi there üëã
---
My name is Lucas Ferreira. I'm a transport planner and data analyst from Brazil. Currently I'm working on Transitar Consultoria and finishing a master's degree in transport planning. 

I just started this account (since 2015, I've had another dedicated to private and team repositories), and I'll put things that I think be usefull in transportation planning and data analysis (or just cool things).

### Research and work interests :bus:
---
I'm particularly interested in issues concerning transportation inequalities and how the planning process can aid in the creation of more equitable cities. My current research examines how budget constraints affect public transportation accessibility, particularly for low-income people, analysing this issue by the Capability Approach (CA) perspective.
